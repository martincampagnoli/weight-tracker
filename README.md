# weight-tracker

Weight tracker app built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) v20.3.2 as frontend framework, [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for design and styling. [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) is used for state management.

This app lets you:

- Add/remove weight entries to track your progress over time
- Set a target goal weight
- Visualize your progress in an interactive chart

Based on [Interwhip](https://github.com/martincampagnoli/interwhip).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for unit tests. Helpful scripts:

- `npm test` — run unit tests
- `npm run test:coverage` — coverage report
- `npm run test:update-snapshots` — update snapshots intentionally

## Project guidelines

See [guidelines.md](./guidelines.md) for the project's best practices and conventions.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
